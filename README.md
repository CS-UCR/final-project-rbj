Our team is excited to go more in depth on the ethical aspect of data science. We are
especially interested in analyzing **differential privacy**.

### Description
Our project will involve researching differential privacy and its implementation into various techniques of data analysis. The concept of differential privacy is fairly recent, and can be implemented using a variety of mechanisms depending on the desired effects on data analysis. We seek to learn some of these mechanisms, as well as their benefits, their potential downsides, and the data analysis techniques that would benefit most from their implementation. We would also like to learn about how the additional noise generated by differential privacy might compound pre-existing noise in data, and how the downsides of such noise might be mitigated. We will also attempt to implement an algorithm for differential privacy to better understand the real-world implications of differential privacy, and how they might differ from the theoretical aspects discussed in academic papers.
