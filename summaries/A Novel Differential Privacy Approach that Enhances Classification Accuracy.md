## Introduction
In order to achieve an adequate level of protective privacy for the individuals that share their data for the purpose of research, there must be appropriate layers of
privacy that are added in order to ensure this. Data anonymization is pivotal to ensuring that data is not breached and allows for protection against public exposure to 
private information. Such anonymization is executed through the use of various different algorithms and techniques. Most typically it is found that the differential 
privacy method is used in interactive frameworks. This particular article covers the adoption of a non-interactive framework which utilizes an algorithm that fulfills 
requirements for $\epsilon$-differential privacy.
